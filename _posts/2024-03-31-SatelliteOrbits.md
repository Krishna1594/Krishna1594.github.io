## The Purpose of this visualization
I really gave this a thought and my reason is simple. Most of the time when I begin analysing a dataset, I simply use a function I know and my results appear or I search for such functions online and use them simply to get my results but what is the mathematics behind it. Did I forget the mathematics? I am an engineer, I rely on equations to solve problems. So, here I am telling my laptop to how to use mathematics and visualize satellites orbittintg around our planet. I want to know the mathematics involved in this topic. A data analyst should also know the mathematics behind the analysis.
