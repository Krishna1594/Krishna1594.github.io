## That sheer tranquility just amazes me!

I don't exactly remember when I got a notification regarding Earth's big brother. Apparently, he decided to meet for a whole month. If you don't believe me you better follow [Nasa](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/)

Just scroll down a little bit and you will see who I'm talking about!

Yes! that's Jupiter and 5 moons and 4 (Io, Ganymede, Europa and Callisto) are visible in this picture. This picture was taken in October 2022 though.

## Just a touch!

Well in early days of my astrophotography, I captured some bad and unclear pictures. To my eyes, when I looked into the eyepiece, the view was unparalleled. Did you know our eyes are the best cameras? like each eye has a resolution of 576MP. For a comparison, your Iphone only has 12MP camera. That's stunning clarity, our eyes have. So, protect your eyes. Eat lot of carrots!ðŸ¤—

Hence, I wanted to take some quality pictures. I used data from my hobby. See how far I have gazed into the skies!

I did a mini-project on my hobby. If you want to know more how I improved my astrophotography, you should visit my [github](https://github.com/Krishna1594/Astrophotography)

Let me know what you think!
