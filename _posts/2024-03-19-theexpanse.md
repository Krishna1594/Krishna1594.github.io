## The Expanse
"The Expanse" is a science fiction television series based on the book series of the same name by James S.A. Corey (the pen name for authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck). Set in a future where humanity has colonized the solar system, the series explores the political, social, and technological challenges faced by various factions as they navigate the complexities of space exploration, colonization, and interplanetary conflict.

The show first aired on December 14, 2015, with the premiere episode titled "Dulcinea." The series originally aired on the Syfy network in the United States. It premiered as a two-episode pilot event, with "Dulcinea" followed by the second episode, "The Big Empty," on the same night. Since then, "The Expanse" has continued to air subsequent seasons, gaining a dedicated fanbase and critical acclaim for its storytelling, world-building, and visual effects.

I really love this show because of the attention-to-detail, which in this show is unparalleled. See for yourself what astrophysicists and astronauts have got to say about "The Expanse":

## The Data

Actually, I was enthralled by the first and second episodes to an extent where I tabulated data as I watched the rest of the showin Microsoft Excel and categorized them per each season. I have tabulated my favorite charavters from each season, the ships, minute details fo each celestial objects as the plot unfolds. Took around 3 weeks 2 days precisely. Moreover, I had to search inside IMDB website for the show's ratings dataset and I used that data in this visualization.
