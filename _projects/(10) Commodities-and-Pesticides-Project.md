# Commodities & Pesticides Data Project

I met lot of farmers in my country in my life. I think I had to hear the farmer's point of view in using any pesticide in agriculture. I asked, "Why do you think it is important to use pesticide?". I was expecting some technical answer such as "peticide kills insects or algea that harm our crops", But he said with a sense of responsibility and concern in his eyes, "If I don't use pesticides, the amount of food I produce will not be enough to feed all my citizens". That was a moral and accountable answer. it is true that population is increasing, at least in India. So basically, they pesticides help farmers grow more food on less land by protecting crops from insects or pests, diseases and weeds as well as raising productivity per hectare. 

We didn't talk about health concerns and that's where government and organizations come into picture. We as consumers undermine the damages of using pesticides, we should be aware nonetheless. I am talking about damages to health and balanced diet. Organizations like USDA ensures that it is safe for consumers to consume a food product/commodity but at tha same time, ensure a good practice of usage of pesticides by farmers. Such organizations have a significant responsibility providing knowledge to farmers in terms of increasing technology and safe practices in agriculture and creating awareness among consumers about the product. 

I think one of the reasons that USDA made this data available to public is to make sure consumers know what they are eating and ensure safe dietary exposure to consumers.
