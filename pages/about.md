# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
You can call me Krishna. As much as I love earth-science🌎🪨 and astrophotography🪐, I love data too. I dive into various datasets to deduce vital insights💡. In my profession🛢️🔥, formations speak in language of numbers, I am merely just an interpreter! 

Armed with programming languages and analytical tools🛠️📈, I navigate through the digital realm, sculpting stories that unveil patterns, predict trends, and guide data-informed decisions.

I am astrophotgrapher, catch me on instagram to see which celestials I have met.
